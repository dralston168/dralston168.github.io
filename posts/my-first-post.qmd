This week, I started my research position in the Mobility Systems Lab (CAR Lab) at Ohio State University. It was an informative week as I got acquainted with the lab environment, met my new colleagues, and began to understand the projects we are working on. Currently, I am working on getting familiar with the tech stack and other tools we use for collabeoration. I am looking forward to contibuting to this research and learning more about the reseach process.

I am particullarly excited to contribute to work on the pipelines for data processing and analysis for the development of AI models for  detection in real-time systems. I am also excited to learn more about knowledge distiliation and getting models to be effective on resource constrained systems.
