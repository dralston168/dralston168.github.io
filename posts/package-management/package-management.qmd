Why do virtual environments exist (and what goes wrong without them)?

virtual enviroments exist to create isolated environments for different projects, allowing each project to have its own set of dependencies without conflicts. Without virtual environments, you might encounter issues where different projects require different versions of the same package, leading to compatibility problems and making it difficult to manage dependencies effectively.

Here is an example of how virtual enviroments can be effective for managing dependencies in a Python project:
